# Personal Configuration
## Visual Studio Code
I use Visual Studio Code to write JavaScript code.

Some configurations are essential for me in this IDE.

I configure it to develop my React JS and React Native projects, and this make my development area more confortable.

This repository have the user settings when you could get the extensions and configurations. Open the settings area using:

```
" Ctrl + , "
```

I hope that would help you too.

Enjoy it.
